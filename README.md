# EmptyEpsilon-linux-buildscript
The purpose of this Bash script is to facilitate and expedite the process of building [EmptyEpsilon](https://daid.github.io/EmptyEpsilon/) on Linux platforms. It handles everything: from installing/updating the build environment, to checking out the source code, to compiling and installing the game.

## Current limitations
- Only works on Ubuntu derivatives 16.04 and above
 - Compatibility can be added for other distributions in the future if there is interest
